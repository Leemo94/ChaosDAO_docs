TO DO:
THIS NEEDS TO BE MODED TO A NEW SECTION - ITS NOT GOVERNANCE AT ALL
THIS NEEDS TO INCLUDE KUSAMA VALIDATOR, ETC
JUST RENAME THIS TO INFRASTRUCTURE OR STAKING OR SOMETHING

# Nomination Pools

Nomination pools allow users to follow the validator staking choices of another account, trusting that the nomination pool operator is knowledgeable about the different validators in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. For instance, people can delegate their validator staking to the ChaosDAO nomination pool which would then select which validators/collators to nominate. This list of chosen validators will not change very frequently. Using a Nomination Pool, users can begin staking with significantly fewer tokens than if they were self-nominating. However, currently you cannot participate in governance with tokens which are staking via nomination pools, which is a major drawback.

On Kusama, the ChaosDAO Nomination Pool is #**75**: **CeDRtNAtLARL4XrErR1ZwTXhzrfLHPCXonn6yZiw428YNvA**

On Polkadot, the ChaosDAO Nomination Pool is #**62**: **14tuuHN7kQy1wivRnexp8vgR2a5Dv8A9vgWscH81Lq9yVhN**
